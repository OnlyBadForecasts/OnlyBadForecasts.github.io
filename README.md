#### Primary Chart
1. 2025-2026 observed SWE at Brighton (solid blue)
2. Median simulated SWE (dashed purple)
3. 10th to 90th percentiles for simulated trajectories (teal band)
4. 1991-2020 historical median (solid red)
5. The past 20 seasons of historical data (thin solid lines of various colors)

#### Secondary Chart
1. Current season observed data as a percent of the historical median (dotted blue)
2. Forecast median as a percent of the historical median (dashed purple)

#### Tertiary Chart
